    <!--Each dot should have a linear infinite animation that will take 750 milliseconds 
        and that will:
Translate it up for 1em
At the highest point, change its background color to #4ebaaa
The dots shouldnâ€™t bounce all at the same time - they should cascade. 250 milliseconds 
after the animation on the first dot has started, the animation on the second dot 
should start. 
The same relationship should be between the second and third dot.-->
